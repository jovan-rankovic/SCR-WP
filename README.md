# SCR-WP
One of my first ever websites.

My first version of Sport Centre Rankovic website, made for Web programming course at the beggining of 2018.
Here I was learning HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, XML, JSON, AJAX, Cookies.
At this point we didn't learn about backend technologies yet, the only dynamic stuff happening is reading from JSON files.
